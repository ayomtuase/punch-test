This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Next.js was used to aid static-site generation.

ShadcnUI and TailwindCSS were used for quick styling and development.

Green Sock Animation Platform was used for scroll animations
